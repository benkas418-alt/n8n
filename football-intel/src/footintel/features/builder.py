"""Pre-match features computed only from information known before each match.

Input: one row per match with columns
    match_id, kickoff_date, season, home_team_id, away_team_id,
    home_goals, away_goals (NaN if not played),
    home_shots, away_shots, home_sot, away_sot (NaN if missing),
    odds_h, odds_d, odds_a (pre-match 1X2 prices, NaN if missing),
    and optionally competition, competition_type, neutral_venue.
Output: the same rows with feature columns added.

Matches are processed in date order. All matches of one day get features from
the state at the end of the previous day; the state is then updated with that
day's results. A match never sees a result from its own day or later.
